The amplifiers are integral part of many analog and digital systems over the years. Amplifiers with different degrees of complexity are used in various circuits. 
The design of such amplifiers is still a challenge as supply voltage and transistor dimensions are getting reduced because of scaling. 
Here, a single stage amplifier with 1 MHz Bandwidth, 25dB Gain and 50 ÂµA Quiescent Current has been implemented using Synopsys Custom Design Platform in 28nm CMOS Technology.
